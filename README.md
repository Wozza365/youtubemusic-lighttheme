# youtubemusic-lighttheme
A light theme for YouTube Music on web with a twist of the classic Google Play Music. This only overrides the styling of the site. It does not alter any functionality, that is not the intention of this.

# How to use it
1. Install the Stylus extension for Chrome (or a browser equivalent): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en
2. Click this button to install the style with Stylus
[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=for-the-badge)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wozza365/youtubemusic-lighttheme/main/output.user.css)

If you want to turn it off, click the Stylus extension icon and then "Turn all styles off".

Feel free to edit the styles to your liking, contribute with a pull request or raise an issue or do whatever the hell you like with it :)

# Future plans
Replace with SCSS for easier editing.
Possibly convert into a Chrome extension if there's enough interest.
